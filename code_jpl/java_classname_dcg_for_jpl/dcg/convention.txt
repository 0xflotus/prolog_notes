% Convention: 
%
% We process list of character codes with the DCG (as opposed to lists of characters)
% In SWI Prolog the character codes are the Unicode code values.
% We can then use backquotes for in-code literals that resolve to such lists:
% ?- X=`alpha`.
% X = [97, 108, 112, 104, 97].
% We will have to examine the unicode code values of any characters to decide
% whether a sequence of characters from a valid Java identifier, so using the
% character code representation is necessary in any case.
% 
% What is the result of parsing? A string or an atom? Unsure! 
% Let's stay with atoms for compatibility.
