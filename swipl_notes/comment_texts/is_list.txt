## Doc error

"a term with functor `[|]` and arity 2" is slightly incorrect.

The functor _is_ `[|]` / 2 i.e. the functor includes the arity.

The [ISO definition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49898738/is-this-prolog-terminology-correct-fact-rule-procedure-predicate) says "functor: An identifier together with an arity."

Better:

"a term with name/identifier `[|]` and arity 2"

## Unit tests

Some unit tests for this predicate: 

[`test_is_list.pl`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code_unit_tests/builtin_demo/test_is_list.pl)

## Checking for an openlist

As used in "difference lists", an **open list** has a "hole" at the last position (denoted by a variable), what I call "Fin", instead of the "empty list" atomic constant:

==
List1    = [1,2,3|[]]
List2    = [1,2,3]      % same as List1
OpenList = [1,2,3|_]    % freshvar at Fin position
OpenList = [1,2,3|Fin]  % name the freshvar
==

Like this. 

   - **proper/closed list** on the left
   - **open list** on the right

==
List ------->[|]                  [|]<-------------- OpenList
            /   \                /   \
           1    [|]             1    [|]
               /   \                /   \
              2    [|]             2    [|]
                  /   \                /   \
                 3     []             3   ~hole~ <--- Fin

A predicate `is_openlist/1` can be found here: 

[`openlist_append.pl`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/openlist_append.pl)

with unit tests:

[`openlist_append.plt`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/openlist_append.plt)
