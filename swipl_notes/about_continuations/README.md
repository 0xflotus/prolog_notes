# Continuations

(Work in progresss)

(But why are they "delimited"?)

(The use of continuations to express an alorithm seems to be in competition with the use of monads to do the same. 
Some people says "monads are better", some differ. In Prolog, it seems to me that monads are rebarbative to implement
as the "monad object" carries context state valid at creation time, same as a closure. So it has to be represented by
some structured object, maybe a dict, which would be a leaf in a tree-of-context. More on this another time maybe.)

In the SWI-Prolog manual: 

- [Delimited Continuations (eu.swi-prolog.org)](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=delcont)
- [Delimited Continuations (www.swi-prolog.org)](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=delcont)

These are the same Ã¨ages but the comment sections differ.

From \[DCP13\] (see below for reference): 

> Delimited continuations enable the definition of new high-level language features at the program level (e.g. in libraries)
> rather than at the meta-level as program transformations. As a consequence, feature extensions based on delimited 
> continuations are more light-weight, more robust with respect to changes and do not require pervasive changes to existing code bases.

## Example: Effect handler for state

In \[DCP13\]: 

> Effect handlers are an elegant way to add many kinds of side-effectful operations to a language
> and \[are\] far less instrusive than monads ... the effect handler decouples the syntax of the
> new operations from their semantics"

**Code: [state_handler.pl](state_handler.pl)**

Diagram it, more or less:

![State Handler](state_handler.svg)

## Example: Iterator

This can be used to model the behaviour of an IO monad for sure. But that needs to be explained and coded in detail.

**Code: [iterator.pl](iterator.pl)**
