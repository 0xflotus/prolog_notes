# SWI-Prolog types

A tree depicting the built-in "base types" one may encounter in SWI Prolog (which are 
similary to the types of other Prolog). As there is no way to construct types from the base types 
these are the only one there are.

- [graphml file](swi_prolog_types.graphml). The editabel diagram. Edited with the free 8but not open) Java-based
[yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) editor (but you have to switch off antialiasing otherwise it feels like driving
an ocean liner).
- [PNG file](swi_prolog_types.png). Awkward to use. 4205 x 3055, 8-bit/color RGB.
- [SVG file](swi_prolog_types.svg). Best. Can be visualized in a browser.
