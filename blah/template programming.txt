Is it template programming instead of logic programming?

atom(X) - Can you give me a template?
atom(X) - Is this template acceptable?

a predicate is a template generator!

member(X,L) is true if (iff) X is an element of the list L

?- open("/tmp/xxx",'write',X),ground(X).
X = <stream>(0x1379cf0).

X --+--> freshvar
    |
    +--> nonvar --+--> ground    (totally concrete (within limits, e.g. what is a stream id ground??)
                  | 
                  +--> nonground (contains vars)
                  
Inside of member:

member(X,L) is true if (iff) X unifies with an element of a list prefix of L


member2(X, [X|_]).
member2(X, [_|Es]) :- member(X, Es).
