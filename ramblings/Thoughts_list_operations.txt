List operations
---------------

On lists of numbers
Or ordered lists
Or ordered sets (ordered lists without duplicates)

Inserting an element
--------------------

Insert an element
- based on its value. The list must be sorted as this implies the correct position
- by giving the index into the list

+ in both cases, "eliminate or keep duplicates"?
+ if "keep duplicates", insert in front of or after a duplicate run?

Checking for an element
--------------------

Member and memberchk.
Checking could be accompanied by splintering of the list.

Finding an element
--------------------

By index: nth0, nth1
  Extension: vectorial nth0 : extract multiple elements at once
By "value": one can determine the position of an element by value
What do you do with the list? One could consider returning the "remainder" 
(that is "selectchk")
or the list front and list back (this is "splintering") of the list

Removal of an element
---------------------

By value (if it exists)
By index
Giving a new list
Or just the list fron/back
Extension: Vectorial removal - Remove multiples by value; Remove multiples by index

Replacing an element
--------------------

Extension: Vectorial replace - replace many elements at the same time.

Adding/Removing in front
------------------------

In Perl: shift/unshift

Adding/Removing at the back
------------------------

In Perl: push/pop

General operation: Splice
-------------------------

Removing/Adding "splices" from/into the list
