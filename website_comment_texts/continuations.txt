## Reading

The link to "Schrijvers et al., 2013." just goes to the bibliography page, where you are then stranded because there is no further link.

Might as well add the link directly:

Delimited continuations for Prolog: https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/publications/iclp2013.pdf - The PDF says it has been written in 2003, but it has really been written in 2013.

## Examples

Inspired "Schrijvers et al., 2013.":

   - Iterator generating output to user-selectable destination (in this case, write/1) using continuations: [`iterator.pl`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_continuations/iterator.pl)

   - State handler using delimited continuations: [`state_handler.pl`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_continuations/state_handler.pl) and a [diagram](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_continuations/state_handler.svg) for that.
