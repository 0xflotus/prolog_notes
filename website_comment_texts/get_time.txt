Returns a float!

Compare with Unix `date` command's "seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" (watch out for the difference in leap seconds between actual UTC and [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) and the difference between [TAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time) and UTC).

?- get_time(T),float(T),process_create('/usr/bin/date',['+%s'],[]).
1604652321  
T = 1604652321.0266113.

**The naming is ... lousy**

It should be an arithmetic function and it should be written:

==
T is the_time()
==

possibly

==
T is the_time_of(now)
== 

which would make much more sense.


`get_time(T)` reads as

   - "`get_time` is an attribute of T", or
   - "Find me a T so that get_time(T) is true" (there is no such T, really)
