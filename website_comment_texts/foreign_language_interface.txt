## Pretty important and not standardized

... this is one more issue that is very much neglected by the ISO core standard:
- Foreign Function Interface (call-in and call-out)

For example Java, Fortran, Pascal, etc.. isn't agnostic to this. And real Prolog systems aren't aswell agnostic to this, lets look at SICStus, what concerns call-out
and even call-in, you have (sorry old release 3 docs): 

Mixing C and Prolog
https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_11.html

Mixing Java and Prolog
https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/3.7.1/html/sicstus_12.html

So we have two neglected issues by the ISO core standard, multi-threading and foreign function interface, and of course all questions about the combination of both.

Nevertheless we hear "industry strength" here and then. A standard is not industry strength if it doesn't cover multi-threading and foreign function interface.

## Update the reference?

I guess referencing Kernighan & Ritchie, 1978, in 2020 (sigh!) is a bit quaint (well, the continuing very existence of C is quaint, but be that as it may be...)

Maybe this book should be used instead:

https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/

*Modern C* by Jens Gustedt

It is definitely larger than K&R at 408 pages. But, it looks like a book I would have liked to have at uni. 

It contains this warning on page 23:

_Experienced C programmers: If you already have some experience with C programming, what follows may take some getting used to or even provoke allergic reactions._
_If you happen to break out in spots when you read some of the code here, take a deep breath and try to relax, but please do not skip these pages._

## Does the manual need auto-update?

It also seems that the headings for the C functions should be updated. A little script to automatically pull then from `${SWIPL_INSTALL}/lib/swipl/include/SWI-Prolog.h` and insert them into the documentation file is recommended.
