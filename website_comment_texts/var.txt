Some notes on the ambiguity concerning the word "variable" can be found [**here**](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_concept_of_variable/README.md)

Note that the above text uses "free", which is inappropriate IMHO.

When you ask `var(X)` you are actually asking whether the _variable name_ `X` currently (at query time, a non-logical concept) designates an and uninstantiated/unbound term.

The predicate would be less confusing if it had been named `unbound(X)`.
