No handling of cyclic terms (for now)

It is confusing that "variables" are named terms, too. It is a confusing between the designator and the designee.
Variables name terms. 

In the following, we will make a strong distinction between variables and terms.

Terms exist in the term store.

Variables exist in code and name terms and subterms on the term store.

Terms are recursive, so a term node is understood to be a node on the tree, whereas the term/subterm is a whole subtree, aka term tree for clarity.

A hole or freshterm is an lace in the term store that holds no term as yet but is meant to hold one during computation.

Holes occur only at the leaf of a term tree.

A term node can also be a hole.

A freshvar or an unbound var or an uninintstantated var names a hole in te term store.

A term node can be atomic or compound. If it is compound and of arity at least 1 it designates further term nodes, possibly holes.

Note that a term node "references" another term node as in "pointerlike reference" or "contains" another term node if one things more in concepts of trees and subtrees,

Given a term tree, we will transform it into a mirrored term tree structured differently.

This is a heavy duty data structure, so we will not shoehorn everything into a conceptually single term (well, it will be a single term, but...)

We will use naming (as in, database indirection) for flexibility.

The original term is deep-copied, the structure taken over 1:1, but each term node:

References the original term node
Is given a unique name
That name is used as lookup in a dict to retrieve a further dict with information about that term node
   This give us the possibility to regenerate information about a term node by replacing an entry in the dict
   instead of excising a term node from the tree and/or using setarg! Natural nomutable state programming FTW.
The patter nto use is the accumulator pattern: A nunmutable structure is passed down the call chain, and possible
modified at each activation (stack frame).


So, there is:

1) lookup dict
2) an inserter; given a lookup dict and a new value it inserts the value under a new, generated name (a number)

This is pretty easy.

What are the values?

Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character for drawing boxes

They are dicts themselves, where positions are relative

   ZXXXXXXXX         The text; Z is position (0,0) (row, col)
       │                    The vertical bar starts at column V
       │                    and uses H.1 rows until it hits the first branch
       ├──                  Then it branches (or just bends if this is the last entry) and just goes left until it hits the next box       
       └──                  The position of the Z of that box is given as "N steps to the right"

The overall screen is divided into term tree and holes at leaves

  |-------- Term tree -------|----- Holes -----|
  |                          |    _1223
  |                          |    _5666   
 
The term tree box is itself a box

In between the Term tree box and the Holes box, there may need to be an 
exchange part where "hole sharing" is indicated.
It needs a colum for every shared "hole" where horizontal lines merge
into a single vertical line which is continued to the right.

the vertical bar is set to the earliest occurrence of the hole
