# About Negation

Who would have though that Negation is fraught like this?

> for a fragment of first-order hereditary Harrop formulae to include negated atoms in goals. This
> gives us a formal framework in which to study the role of Negation as Failure rule. The class of predicates
> for which Negation As Failure is applicable is discussed, as well as the predicates for which some other form of negation
> will need to be used. We show how the former class may be incorporated into the model theory, giving a 
> generalisation of the usual T^𝜔 construction. No restriction on the class of programs is needed for this approach; the
> construction may be used for programs which are not locally stratified [T. Przymusinski, On the Declarative Semantics of Deductive
> Databases and Logic Programs, Foundations of Deductive Databases and Logic Programming, (ed. J. Minker) 193-216, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988].
> This is accomplished by the use of a _success level_ and a _failure level_ of a goal, either or both of which may be infinite.
> The resulting T operator is not monotonic, which necessitates a slight departure from the standard
> procedure, but the important properties of the construction still hold.
