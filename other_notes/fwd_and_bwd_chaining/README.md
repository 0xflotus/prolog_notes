This an offshoot from this question on StackOverflow: [Forward and Backward Chaining](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62376526/forward-and-backward-chaining).

One error is that CHR does not do backtracking (it is "commited choice" - the backtracking is provided by the calling Prolog system). To be corrected!
